## License Plate Game

This is a simple web application that can solve the following license plate game:

Given an ordered list of three letters, provide the shortest word that includes all three letters in the listed order with any number of other letters in between.

I wrote a brute-force iterative solution to this problem a few years ago. This project revisits the problem more creatively by using a tree data structure representing all English words, then traversing that tree to create the list of solutions to any input string.
